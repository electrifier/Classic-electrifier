# History

Released | Version | Details
:------: | :-----: | :------
04/05/19 | 0.1.1 | An internal alpha test is currently in progress

Originally, the project was started back in 2004, using .NET-framework 1.0 and Windows XP. However, due to a system crash, I lost all my data, including the source-code, which was stored on a software RAID-5.

Meanwhile I managed to restore those lost artefacts, converted them to Visual Studio 2019 and .NET 4.6 and relaunched the development cycle.

# Development

electrifier is developed using Visual Studio Community 2019 and uses .NET-framework 4.6.
